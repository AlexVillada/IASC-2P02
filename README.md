# IASC 2P02 // Alex Villada

## Bio

My name is Alex Villada and I am a second year student in the IASC program at Brock University. My research area revolves around text analysis, and my research program involves doing analytical and problem solving tasks with text analysis tools. This research focus is reflected in my academic projects, that I have included in this portfolio, such as a project that looks at collaborative research contribution as well as a solo research development. similarly, my academic blog looks at an analysis of comparing different authors’ contextual meanings in the Digital Humanities department. I'd like to continue with this work in the future by doing research revolving different forms of media communication, as well as contemporary technology. Contemporary technology is always ever growing, and there are always new obstacles, and blockades that come and stagger research, being able to overcome those obstacles, is a great learning experience, builds skill set and requires patience and perseverance. An example of this would be my academic blog, as well as solo research presentation, as I’ve had many changes and process changes when compiling them together. With that being said, I’d like to continue in this field as a data analyst and problem solver with contemporary and future technology.
