# IASC 2P02 // Alex Villada

## Bio

My name is Alex Villada and I am a second year student in the IASC program at Brock University. My research area revolves around text analysis, and my research program involves doing analytical and problem solving tasks with text analysis tools. This research focus is reflected in my academic projects, that I have included in this portfolio, such as a project that looks at collaborative research contribution as well as a solo research development. similarly, my academic blog looks at an analysis of comparing different authors’ contextual meanings in the Digital Humanities department. I'd like to continue with this work in the future by doing research revolving different forms of media communication, as well as contemporary technology. Contemporary technology is always ever growing, and there are always new obstacles, and blockades that come and stagger research, being able to overcome those obstacles, is a great learning experience, builds skill set and requires patience and perseverance. An example of this would be my academic blog, as well as solo research presentation, as I’ve had many changes and process changes when compiling them together. With that being said, I’d like to continue in this field as a data analyst and problem solver with contemporary and future technology.

## Featured Project: (Wax Cylinder Phonograph)

![](images/FeaturedPic.png)
This is a solo presentation I’ve compiled. The guidelines specified that we needed to compile a Pecha Kucha presentation, which if you aren’t familiar with the format, the presentation consists of 20 slides, and they advance every 20 seconds, which translates to an exact 5 minute presentation. The topic of choice I decided to talk about was a forgotten sound recording technique with wax cylinders. In this presentation, I touch base on the origin, how the mechanism worked, the peripherals used, and overall basic information. Later in the presentation, I talk about what the technology means today and how it’s evolved. I mention that microphones are the current day equivalent, however, there was a recent case where famous Youtube creator Rob Scallon, experimented with this 100 year old technology, in current day conditions and applications. Going back to my presentation, I’ve also touched base with MIDI notes, and how MIDI, and these wax cylinders, bare very similar resemblances. My overall basis of this research presentation was to talk about how media archeology between an old piece of technology and the current day equivalent, and the common techniques and similarities, and It’s interesting to see how things have evolved overtime.  

The research for this project changed a lot overtime. At the beginning, I wanted to solely talk about the old tech, and the new. I started off by doing research on the wax cylinder, as well as the peripheral used for recording sound into the cylinder, and finally, how the entire process works, and the applications. It was a bit difficult to find information that would be useful to use, however I then got to a point where I had so much information to use, I didn’t know what to include, and what to cut. As I’ve progressed with gathering the information, I decided to divide the presentation in 2 different sections. Starting off with the section for the past piece of technology, which is the wax cylinder device, and the future, which is now the present, being microphones, DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), audio interfaces, and more. My final presentation had a few pieces of instructor feedback. One, my original presentation had too many lines of text. With it being a timed presentation, and having 20 seconds per slide, I was having a bit of a struggle with getting all of my ideas out when presenting. With that being said, I scaled back my slides, and added more pictures, instead of lines of text, which would be too script-like. Another piece of feedback I’ve been given was that there was a bit of a loss of translation, at the beginning of the presentation, with the talk of the history of the Wax Cylinder. This might’ve been because of the amount of information  i tried to convey, and again, I scaled it back, wanting to be more simple, yet effective, and not overwhelming.

I made these changes, which you can see [here](https://github.com/AlexVillada/IASC-2P02/commit/cb547a874c6bcc10496c04793a7864ae7ae558c9#diff-abdf882c25e08d9ba219fe33f17591fe).

Overall these changes show x and y changes in my thinking.
