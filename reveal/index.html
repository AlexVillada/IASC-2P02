The wax worked with different machines in conjunction of different purposes. Whether it was to reproduce sound recordings or record sounds, there were different physical components that needed to be present for each purpose. The machines varied in slight differences, with each diaphragm unit being different for recording and producing sounds. The body of the unit was also different, both of them were manually operated, as they had cranks for them to work and do their job. Later innovative inventions of reproducing and recording sounds were automated.

Wax eventually faded off as different forms of sound manipulation became more apparent. Electrical recordings with the phonograph became the mainstream, later on microphones became prominent. However that took time. Magnetic recordings came after electrical, electrical included cassette tapes, floppy disks, tape recordings and video tapes. Afterwards, digital recordings came into fruition, and became the mainstream format, as CDs and other forms of digital audio started showing up. Digital audio recordings are where we are today, and we have been at digital since the 80s with little to no intention of moving on.

Current day technologies include many forms of audio techniques and physical pieces of equipment. This includes audio interfaces, which help record sound into the computer, digitally, microphones which have improved technically, and have gotten better and more intricate. As well as DAWs which stand for Digital Audio Workstations, these softwares are what audio engineers use to manipulate, record and produce sounds and music for movies, musicians, video games and more. The softwares are what bridge the person, and the audio, which allows the human to manipulate the audio in ways that weren’t possible otherwise.

Current day microphones have improved significantly within the last 60 years. Modern microphones have higher input capabilities, built in FX such as gates, which filters out unwanted noise under a certain level of volume, and they give crisp recordings. Different microphones are for different reasons, such as condenser microphones, which are more sensitive than dynamic microphones, which are ideal for capture things like footsteps, and birds chirping. Dynamic microphones are less sensitive, and they are more ideal for capture a vocalist in a vocal booth for example.

The future of audio recording hasn’t been apparent for a long time, and no one is sure as to when the innovation will come. Master audio engineers have been able to produce their signature plugins packages, which allows the general public to purchase them, and use similar techniques as the audio engineer and get good sound manipulating results fast, for different purposes. As to the topic of where will recording go? It’s hard to tell, it seems as if digital is the way to go, and will be for many coming years.
