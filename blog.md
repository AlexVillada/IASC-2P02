Throughout the years, the field of humanities in post education has been evergrowing, and with recent technological advancements, we’ve been able to delve into a whole new front of DH. In this discussion today, we will be taking a look at Johanna Drucker, a Breslauer Professor of Bibliographical Studies Department of Information Studies at UCLA. Drucker has been very keen on this matter in her article titled “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display.” However, she brings the argument that all data needs to be understood as capta, Rather than data, which she believes is a different way of categorizing information. We’ll take a look through each example shortly and analyze the differences. She also says the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation. In this blog post, we’ll be going taking a look at what she’s said throughout her article, and at the end, I’ll give my personal thoughts and impressions.

Let’s start off with the topic at hand of Capta vs Data. As I touched on before Capta and Data are two different kinds of information. Capta, as she describes it, is information which is extracted, interpreted and represented in a certain way, and is loosely representative of reality. On the opposition, Data, as she describes, is represented and produced empirically by the observer, and represents reality more accurately. I feel when observing something for research, it’s appropriate to be impartial, as there are exceptions to everything. Capta gives a representation for an interpretation, by the overseer. Which again, is a small portion of reality, and can be loosely based on reality, as there could be similar results when comparing the information to a much larger scale. Christopher Chippindale of Cambridge University agrees with this way of thinking, as in his article “Capta and Data: On the True Nature of Archaeological Information”, he mentions the following:

Is the customary word "data" a good name for archaeological records and facts? "Data" means the things that are "given," but archaeological observations and facts are never given at all. Rather, they are captured by the researcher, who seeks to grasp from the material record the essentials of some complex and little-known phenomenon, often remote in time and usually ambiguous in material expression. We should prefer to use the better word "capta," the things that have been captured, and to realize that this word captures the essence of what we do. (Chippindale, C. (2000). Capta and Data: On the True Nature of Archaeological Information. American Antiquity, 65(4), 605-612. doi:10.2307/2694418)

With that being said, I definitely see why we would want to stand impartial when gathering data, as it gives more accurate results, and isn’t impersonating a fact or study that can be misused and can lead people to be misinformed. 


	Secondly, moving onto the subject of visualizing the information, and how this plays a part in Capta and Data. Below is a visual representation on Drucker’s article and the most frequently used words and terms, and the correlations within one another.

When looking at both visualizations, we can see a clear correlation between the terms; Graphical, Information and Interpretation. Drucker’s article is all about whether information gathered should be considered capta and not data, as we’ve touched on before. One great example from Drucker’s article is her representation of Stress level and Perceived time in Figure 10. This particular sense goes great with students and exam times. The values of the visualizations stay the same. As time moves forward toward the exam date, the students’ anxiety and nervousness increases. Of course there are many exceptions and conditions, such as if the student has studied, went to class, and if they are confident with the material. The different conditions contribute to this, as this representation is just an interpretation of the information collected, by the certain demographic. However, just like Drucker says, this is only an interpretation of the demographic, and not an accurate representation of all students.

	If I were to connect Drucker’s piece to another author that we’ve touched base on in class, I’d want to talk about McGann and Samuel’s Deformance and Interpretation. In the article, they talk about poems and literature, and the different ways of deconstructing their meaning and intent. If we take a look at this visualization that compares both texts, we see a very interesting correlation, it reminds me of a spider web.

There is a very steady correlation, mainly with interpretation, but it serves a purpose, as they both mention interpretive pieces, and not factual data. In the case of McGann and Samuel, they discuss the interpretation of literature and text, when Drucker discusses the interpretation of a visual representation. These are very similar and go hand in hand, as the principal is the same, however the context is different. They both show impartialness when analyzing these kinds of pieces and encourage an impartial mindset when deconstructing either text or information that has been extracted for research.


	In conclusion, I agree with Drucker’s main arguments and points. Drucker makes it clear that it’s important to give off the right information, so they information is not misused and doesn’t misinform. Capta is how we should be analyzing most information that has been extracted, as long as they don’t include factual evidence and proof that it is a reliable source of information. As far as we are concerned, most surveys and graphs demonstrating statistics have been extracted/tested with a certain demographic, however like I’ve said earlier, there are exceptions to everything, and that kind of data should give a sense of direction, rather than factual belief.
